* game simulation is done directly on prop/player objects e.g. player.setInt("stockhp", 0);
* only in network files should we deal with taking these values from the server and putting them into the hashmap
of "netargs".  i.e. don't want calls to nServer.argmap all over the code EXCEPT in nVars or nServer
* keep in mind that only deltas are sent over in a nettick packet
    -> gamestate vars go into player objects
    -> netargs retained in netargmap
    -> temporary send/recv vars are in "packArgs" in net receive funcs
* WORK ON UI LAST
* NEW cvars do not work with the "cv_" prefix in console
    -> lets leave it like this from now on... too many probs can arise
        -> i.e. someone is able to create their own exploits by making up cvars for use with nefarious scripts or w/e
* i think addSendCmd(id,.. puts "server" in the sendcmd map, and everything happens twice after that
* for the server to "say" something to clients, "echo" the proper string (with or without "name:" ) in addSendCmd
* max allowable server/client rate is 1000
* use wasloaded map variable to avoid exceptions that may occur when net/gfx threads outpace map loading thread
* for drawing gfx such as arrows, labels, etc.. use the player object. for vars, use the netmap
* fun stuff: giveweapon 86011035 3;sendcmd 86011035 cv_weaponstock3 18;sendcmd 86011035 userplayer weapon 3
