* game simulation is done directly on prop/player objects e.g. player.setInt("stockhp", 0);
* only in network files should we deal with taking these values from the server and putting them into the hashmap
of "netargs".  i.e. don't want calls to nServer.argmap all over the code EXCEPT in nVars or nServer
* keep in mind that only deltas are sent over in a nettick packet
    -> gamestate vars go into player objects
    -> netargs retained in netargmap
    -> temporary send/recv vars are in "packArgs" in net receive funcs
* WORK ON UI LAST
* NEW cvars do not work with the "cv_" prefix in console
    -> lets leave it like this from now on... too many probs can arise
        -> i.e. someone is able to create their own exploits by making up cvars for use with nefarious scripts or w/e
* i think addSendCmd(id,.. puts "server" in the sendcmd map, and everything happens twice after that
* for the server to "say" something to clients, "echo" the proper string (with or without "name:" ) in addSendCmd
* max allowable server/client rate is 1000
* use wasloaded map variable to avoid exceptions that may occur when net/gfx threads outpace map loading thread
* for drawing gfx such as arrows, labels, etc.. use the player object. for vars, use the netmap
* fun stuff: giveweapon 86011035 3;sendcmd 86011035 cv_weaponstock3 18;sendcmd 86011035 userplayer weapon 3
* ISSUE: startpaused must be init as 1 in svars.java for mapmaker to work right
* for now, using the mousewheel creates powerups in a local game lol
    -> good for demonstrations
* you CAN include commands in a prefab
    -> so to make something happen, spawn a prefab containing the relevant code
* testing weapons
    -> SERVER: giveweapon <id> 3
    -> CLIENT: cv_weaponstock3 18;userplayer weapon 3
* fun situation
    -> see enemy on other side of wall, you either have to PURSUE or you have to FLEE
        -> FLAGMASTER:
            -> PURSURE: you see the flag/carrier
            -> FLEE: you are the carrier
        -> POWERUPS:
            -> PURSUE: superspeed, superdmg, supershield, invisibility
* go over red flag item, it disappears
    -> get id: userplayer id
    -> do: dropflagred <userplayer id>
* weird issue where game totally breaks if "uiInterface.init" is called before "display.showframe" AND
    -> AND settings.width == config.width
    -> i think it has to do with "checkresolution" not triggering the display/frame init/refresh in this case
* spawn in with 'createuserplayer;respawn;pause'
* enter spectate with removeplayer <id>
    -> calling this on client only removes from client's screen
    -> the client should "request" this command from the server
        -> client will have command called "removeuserplayer" that will reach out to server, who will run
            removeplayer <id>
* respawning
    -> (SERVER/LOCAL) spawn server/local with "respawn".  calls "spawnplayer"
    -> (SERVER) "respawnnetplayer" handles clients/bots respawning, calls "spawnplayer" locally and fanout for clients
    -> (ALL) "spawnplayer" actually creates player object at coords determined by server (prev call)
* online mapmaker
    -> start game with "-editor" flag
    -> start server with "newgame"
    -> join with "joingame"
    -> gospectate/gounspectate work great for dynamic testing
* for server's user, sending cmds to the server should result in server executing it on itself
    -> the server user's client doesnt need to execute, just see what happens on the server
* for netclients, addnetcmd does not execute clientside unless its "fireweapon"
* dont use server code/scenes/objects in display routines
