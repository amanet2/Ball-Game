* SERVER BROWSER
    -> Have server thread check in every 30 seconds to update player count
    -> use scheduledEvents when starting the server/newgame (whichever is more sensible)
* IP SAFETY
    -> ensure IP addresses used to join games aren't saved anywhere
    -> "joinip" argument should not be used to join games unless from the join by ip menu
