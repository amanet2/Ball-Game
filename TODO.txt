* FREEZING: major hitches randomly during gameplay
    -> THEORY: thread-safe data structures holding things up?
* AI: bots need to go around obstacles
    -> detect if they have not moved enough X,Y in a certain time frame and begin the 'go-around' behavior
        -> go-around behavior: turn 90 degrees left or right (randomly selected) and keep that movement for 2000ms
