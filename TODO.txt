* UI: show arrow over user's HUD hp & score
* UI: show tiny img of weapon that killed player
    -> cancel sign for the landmine
    -> the echo cmd for "X got Y" is in a script
    -> make a new token '&' that's like '#'
        -> but instead of a color it speicifies a killfeed icon
* sort scoreboard players tiebreaker by score
    -> or dont show score on TAB scoreboard
* enable mapName the same way as gametheme and gamemode
    -> setvar mapname, cl_setvar mapname
    -> default to the filename if unset
        -> for new maps, use "map0"
    -> need a dialog/entry form in mapmaker editor
* BUG, UI: maps dont fit on selection screen
* GFX: make the flagdeposits and scorepoints do a color effect
* NET, UI: have client time out when connection is lost
    -> Multipurpose for A losing connection to game
    -> and B trying to join a server that cant be reached
    -> echo some message on screen for this
* ITEM: boost pad that gives high player velocity in a certain direction
* CRITICAL: whats with the jittering when framerate isnt 360fps?
* VFX: using gradient inside the texture makes performance much better on macbook
    -> but the tiling doesnt line up exactly at some points
* BUG: flag disappeared during flagmaster game
* BUG: extra flags appearing during flagmaster game
* CRITICAL: client.txt gets cleared out randomly?
* make created prefabs available right away without having to restart game
    -> can add the new prefab's script into the prefab map at some point
* come up with better way to create and place map geometry where we dont have to define rotations manually
    -> use java polygons
* Make Camera scriptable with 'setcam' console command
* create onShot script capability for items and players when they get hit by bullet object
* replace all usages of "Math.Random()" with threadlocal random
* BUG VIDEO:
    -> uiMenus framerate selection needs to update with the client vars file
* MEMORY LEAK
    -> with sound?
        -> even with sound muted I see memory going up in task manager
        -> noticed shitload of threads being created when i enabled sounds
        -> try closing the audio line
    -> with animations?
        -> with muted audio and no animations, mem hovers around 300mb give or take
* Client, Server interp
    -> everytime client receives from server it sets "coords"
    -> create some config value that will set this to only occur every X milliseconds
* COMMANDS:
    -> server var to not allow movement for ID or all
* add race gamemode
* GIT: want to go back in time
    -> git checkout <old working commit>
    -> git checkout -b <new branch>
    -> push this branch then retarget the older branch into this new stable branch, stable branch targets main now
* TWO COMMITS TANGLED UP
    -> on target: git config pull.rebase true && git pull && git config pull.rebase false
* Engine: xCon console should be split up into server and client
* BUG: Escape comma ',' characters that appear in net values
    -> it screws up building hashmap from received data
* GENERAL: if a client is also running the server, cl_setthing can be called by the server thread if server not ignored (bad)
* BUG: teleporters delay affects different colors i.e. blue teles are affected by red tele delay and vice versa
* create a client var for player id to track with the camera
* BUG: when someones pc sleeps/closes, the client loses connection then rejoins on wake as "null"
* git reset --hard <last_working_commit_id>
    -> git push --force
    -> git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name> --force
    -> see for remotes: git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>
* NET: Have server not send any other clients' vars if the client is still loading
* NET: The maximum safe UDP payload is ??? bytes
* add cod zombies-style gametype, bots will be unarmed but real players will always have weapons
    -> or moving items can act as zombies
* GAME: bring back squish effect for movement/momentum changes and bounces
* new Item: destructible box/crate
    -> get itemvar "health" to 0 and it should exec spawnpointgiverbonus script
* other attacks:
    -> rock from maniac gungame
    -> hold mouse to blow a bubble and launch it before it pops
* COMMIT SPOT CHECKS
    -> GO TO COMMIT: git checkout <commit>
    -> GO BACK: git checkout <branch_name>
* PLAYING CLIPS NEED TO CHANGE VOLUME IMMEDIATELY ON CHANGE
* add "disable attacks" option
* make players eyes blink
