* FREEZING: major hitches randomly during gameplay
    -> THEORY: thread-safe data structures overused and holding things up?
* AI: bots need to go around obstacles
    -> detect if they have not moved enough X,Y and begin the 'go-around' behavior
* CRITICAL: client.txt gets cleared out randomly?
* CHECK FOR MEMORY LEAKS
* BUG: Escape comma ',' characters that appear in net values
* GENERAL: if a client is also running the server, cl_setthing can be called by the server thread if server not ignored (bad)
* BUG: when someones pc sleeps/closes, the client loses connection then rejoins on wake as "null"
* AUDIO: PLAYING CLIPS NEED TO CHANGE VOLUME IMMEDIATELY ON CHANGE
