* FREEZING: major hitches randomly during gameplay
    -> THEORY: thread-safe data structures holding things up?
    -> IDEA: only worry about client and shell for handling the freeze issue
    -> OBSERVATION: during a freeze it seems the camera moved up and had to travel back to player position
    -> OBSERVATION: "client_update" prints out while game was freezing and "shell_update" did not
        -> "shell_update" was not printing out at this time
            -> this means "shellLogic.render()" is not finishing
            -> "paintComponent" in dPanel used -concurrent- data structures
    -> OBSERVATION: freezes seem to happen when there are bots
    -> OBSERVATION: from a pure client, I didn't see any freezing
    -> IDEA: maybe a while() loop in the server is causing freezes
        -> while loop is used to dequeue server cmds
