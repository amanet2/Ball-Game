* NET, UI: have client disconnect itself when connection is lost for X seconds
    -> Multipurpose for A) losing connection to game
    -> and B) trying to join a server that cant be reached
    -> echo some message on failure
* BUG, UI: maps dont fit on selection screen
    -> need two columns and special ui handling
* BUG: whats with the freezes?
    -> THEORY: thread-safe data structures overused and holding things up
* UI: show tiny img of weapon that killed player
    -> the echo cmd for "X got Y" is in a script
    -> make a new token '&' that specifies a killfeed icon
        -> e.g. 'echo host#blue &pistol guest#pink'
* GFX: make the flagdeposits and scorepoints do a color effect
    -> use color flare and color the shadow
* ITEM: create onShot script capability for items and players when they get hit by bullet object
    -> shoot landmines to disable them
    -> NEW ITEM: box that you break open for prize
* ITEM: boost pad that gives high player velocity in a certain direction
* BUG: flag disappeared during flagmaster game
* BUG: extra flags appearing during flagmaster game
* CRITICAL: client.txt gets cleared out randomly?
* QOL: make created prefabs available right away without having to restart game
    -> can add the new prefab's script into the prefab map at some point
* VIDEO:
    -> uiMenus framerate selection needs to update with client vars
* MEMORY LEAK
    -> with sound?
        -> even with sound muted I see memory going up in task manager
        -> noticed shitload of threads being created when i enabled sounds
        -> try closing the audio line
    -> with animations?
        -> with muted audio and no animations, mem hovers around 300mb give or take
* COMMANDS and VARS:
    -> server var to not allow movement for IDs or all
    -> server var to not allow attacks for IDs or all
    -> 'cl_setcam' console command to set cam position
    -> client var for player id to track with the camera
    -> client var for interp
    -> server var for map name
        -> client var to sync to this as well
* Engine: xCon console should be split up into server and client
* BUG: Escape comma ',' characters that appear in net values
    -> it screws up building hashmap from received data
* GENERAL: if a client is also running the server, cl_setthing can be called by the server thread if server not ignored (bad)
* BUG: teleporters delay affects different colors i.e. blue teles are affected by red tele delay and vice versa
* BUG: when someones pc sleeps/closes, the client loses connection then rejoins on wake as "null"
* NET: Have server not send any other clients' vars if the client is still loading
* NET: The maximum safe UDP payload is ??? bytes
* GAME: bring back squish effect for movement/momentum changes and bounces
    -> OR be able to squish on command
* AUDIO: PLAYING CLIPS NEED TO CHANGE VOLUME IMMEDIATELY ON CHANGE
