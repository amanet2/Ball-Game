FOCUS ITEMS
* make a cArg class
    -> have it work like garg but be for local instances
    -> garg-like
* turn timelimit into a gARg
    -> onChange -> restart timer
* Create arg class that will utilize observer pattern to handle onChange() stuff
    -> find the arg the same way we do in console
    -> on the change, call the onChange() function which will notify observer(s)
        -> e.g. vidmode arg onChange() will refresh the frame/stuff
            -> no more checkX() functions
* think of how to build maps/prefabs out of only collisions and floors
* try using graphics scale/translate with the gamescale instead of eutils in every draw op
* move the dim/4 stuff to the preview block build call, not draw
* figure out a way to build blocks using a true top down 2d view (matrix rotation)
    -> graph paper
* move all cvars into autoexec-type of file
* fix memory leaks
* make objects have "cast shading/shadows" tag
* put the xCom classes into their own folder
* make it so you have separate "waypoint-WITH-arrow" and "waypoint-WITHOUT-arrow"
    -> so we don't have explicit checks for virus mode in the "drawWaypoints" function
* create visibleCommand subclass so we dont manually add xcom objects to this visiblecommands list in xCon
* on slopes, only cancel the relevant movementdir (unless at perfect angle)
* for pause menu, show/hide menubar and use that for unified settings/etc
    -> frame.instance().getJMenuBar has setVisible function that works
* see what "checkX" functions we can get rid of/change to commands
    -> e.g. instead of checking resolution, have a comm "changeresolution"
* MAP IDEA: make "pods" that are two tiles wide, one tile long, for spawning
    -> a shotgun will be on the spawn point, a teleporter on the other tile
        -> we will end up with only as many spawnpoints as teleporters
* git reset --hard <last_working_commit_id>
    -> git push --force
    -> git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name> --force
* make boxing glove the first powerup
* make server code work independently outside of uiInterface/per-frame functions
* cubes were given shorter shadows and corners GOT shadows, but it broke demo.map shadows
    -> because that map drew shadows half under the casting block for realism in archways, etc
* 3D tile editor?
* race gametype?
* player and name are shaky
    -> but not at 240fps
* flag should appear under tops at times
* playercolor is set by console command in halo's engine (in-game)
* make font in menubars bigger
    -> maybe...  we'll have trouble fitting all prefabs on screen
* GAME: player and names are shaky
* NET: max of 4 players right now
* BOTS: they're shaky
* MAPNAME: has to be a thing
* NET: Have server not send any other clients' vars if the client is still loading
* NET: The maximum safe UDP payload is 508 bytes. (stackoverflow)
* EDITOR: keep the old export_prefab stuff around as a console command
* MAPMAKER: show all user's preview rect on all clients, label them by name like google doc
###
### POWER GAP
###
* WEAPONS: send a holdingmouse netvar when holding mouse
    -> clients will simulate the fire rate
        -> server holds master state still
    -> instead of sending cmd fireweapon
    -> allows smooth use of automatic weapons
* ATTACK: the rock from gungame
    -> have it bounce lazily
* GAME: edit popups to say things like "#%&@!" when player takes dmg
* GAME: bring back squish effect for something
* ENGINE: create "shadowblock" object that exists to be a shadow which you can add to prefabs
* GFX: shade the lower boxes/cubes a little darker than the high walls
* GAME: in virus, give players infinite ammo
    -> infected have boxing glove
    -> survivors have shotguns
* WAYPOINTS: instead of a complicated-ass system, have the server sync a "waypoints" list with clients
    -> ..., "waypoints": "x:y:arrow/x:y:arrow", ...
* new Item: bonusblock
    -> (make them look like regular blocks)
    -> get its health to 0 and it has a change to spawn a powerup
        -> powerups: small mode, big mode, shotgun(?), bigger rock, fire rate ++, health++
        -> this will be the powerup delivery system.  no placing shotties on map, etc
    -> will respawn after X time
* Interesting attack:
    -> hold mouse to increase size of projectile
    -> click mouse to start blowing up a bubble. click again to launch it before it pops
        -> can get a bigger bubble, skillfully make small ones etc
* other attack:
    -> rock lazily flies for a time
        -> stopped/bounces by walls/players
    -> explodes on a timer
    -> right click could leave a bomb at player loc, left click launches it
* CONSOLE: have a MAX_LINES value to keep the console from having like 1 million lines and slowing down the game
* FUTURE: we can make "themes" for prefabs
* make players bounce off each other
    -> if a player is slower than another, make them take more and the other take less force accordingly
* add ball skins
    -> use existing color architecture
* avoid casting from WIDE scope to NARROWER scope as it introduces overhead
* add zombies gametype, a zopmbie will be a prop
    -> how many ID:coord:coord:attack sets can we cram in a send string
* cant have key bound to multiple actions
* COMMIT SPOT CHECKS
    -> GO TO COMMIT: git checkout <commit>
    -> GO BACK: git checkout <branch_name>
* make sure different timezones and computer times work correctly
* only draw gfx that will be seen
* ISSUE: BULLETS AND ANIMATIONS CAUSE GAME TO STUTTER ON FIRST EXECUTE B/C NOT IN IMAGE MAP YET
* BG MUSIC TRACK/PLAYING CLIPS NEED TO CHANGE VOLUME IMMEDIATELY ON CHANGE
* pong gametype but the players are human paddles
* gungame mode
* put a mini version of the character next to name in scoreboard
    -> with a crown on winner
* start showing errors in debug log
* powerup idea
    -> egg, pick up to initiate the growing sequence
    -> chuck or drop it before it blows
* add "disable attacks" option
* need to see a visual pallette for selecting tiles
* checksum checks
    -> client sends checksum of the jar, and the map file currently played
    -> server verifies these two MD5 hashes against its own md5s
* gametype
    -> bot going after nearest character
        -> if you touch the bot you die
        -> get points for staying alive
* make players eyes blink
* add texture tiling
    -> sprite must be converted to bufferedimage before drawing
* Create a server browser program
* add voip
