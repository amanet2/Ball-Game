==DISTRIBUTION==
* rename game ballmaster general
    -> roller ruckus

* create update patches
    -> zip up all the update files in same dir structure as existing BRA
    -> create NSIS zip2exe to extract updates into BRA folder

==ISSUES==
* client not removing the forbidden sign after spawn protection
    -> also client wont see anybody elses spawn protection
    -> works on grey_tiles branch but not player_ids
        -> creep print statments in grey_tiles branch until you narrow down where it doesnt work in new branch
* refactoring scores
    -> use the new scoresmap to hold wins, score, kils, ping
    -> refactore all of cScripts.createDamagePopup to start
        -> spaghetti leads:
            -> the whole dang scoreboard
            -> nServer.givePoint(index)
* start game, player 2 join.  player 3 join.  player 2 quit.  player 3 try to kill player 1. player 1 doesnt go to graveyard
* replace "tag" with "id" for weapon stuff
    -> under working name "srcid"
* rename "isVal" to "isString"
* FUCKIN A
    -> GO TO COMMIT: git checkout <commit>
    -> GO BACK: git checkout <branch_name>
* too much sent in new powerups string
* sometimes bots become invulnerable
    -> happens after end of first game, non-server player cant kill bot
* make sure different timezones and computer times work correctly
    -> client timeout: systemtime has a chance of always being greater than checkin time by a magnitute of <timeout>
        -> due to timezones, system clock etc
    -> $$$ make timestamp-centric operations happen server-side, as usual, to fix these issues $$$
* bots wont go for flag in kof if another bot owns that flag
* I think the first sent packet from the client has a chance of sending garbage for velocities and movedirs b/c a player isnt spawned yet
* only draw gfx that will be seen
* sounds are dragging down performance
    -> was better when javafx wasnt working
* bots really drag down performance
    -> check if the rates are influencing it.  maybe bots are updating at server rate and dragging down performance
* EDITOR - NEWTILE - dim0h didnt change when setting base dims
* find a way to change corner's "wall height"
* Bot dont explode on other clients screen
* EDITOR: texture not included when copying/injecting tile dimensions
* many cvars need to be changed to a each-player var for the sake of future usability
    -> features like BOTS and perhaps split screen multiplayer
* need to restrict certain console commands if a client is playing
    -> 'addbot' and many more to be sure
* scores get fucked up when people/bots quit and rejoin
* editor: sidescroller block size did not change dim6h during quick dim adjustment (arrow keys)
* ISSUE: BULLETS AND ANIMATIONS CAUSE GAME TO STUTTER ON FIRST EXECUTE B/C NOT IN IMAGE MAP YET
* ISSUE: SERVER NOT GOING TO THE PROPER COORDS AFTER DYING, AFTER A CLIENT QUITS
    -> java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 2 out of bounds for length 2

   -> doing calls like matchKills[getInt("tag")] dont work because tags arent changed when ppl quit
* CRASH: handle characters who are it/viral quitting
    -> virus: remove player from the virus state string, if nobody infected after quit then re-assign virus
    -> tag: re-assign "itness"
* EDITOR: Tighten up the undo/redo
* BG MUSIC TRACK/PLAYING CLIPS NEED TO CHANGE VOLUME IMMEDIATELY ON CHANGE

==FEATURES==
* mapmaker
    -> ctrl+click to highlight multiple tiles (maybe click & drag to create a rectangular zone?)
    -> have option in the tile menu to "move tile group"
        -> only give ability to edit x,y coords for now
        -> build up to copy/past tile group
        -> also build up to "transform/flip" tile group

* powerup idea
    -> egg
    -> pick up
    -> do something to initiate the growing sequence
    -> chuck it before it blows, or drop it
* introduce ability to queue-up console cmds for passing to clients
    -> would wait for the "cmdreceived" before sending the next
* reintroduce powerups, would function the way weapons used to
    -> powerup spawn points have 0/1 switch, present a random powerup
    -> on-fire like bomberman (touch ppl, they die)
    -> tiny and fast
    -> big slow and shielded
* be sure to make as many variant maps for the different gamemodes
* add "disable attacks" flag
    -> would only be fun in specific gamemodes
    -> could be a map string
* add ability for map to have a sound play on each score
    -> would be manually exec'd with a line
    -> integrate into mapmaker as well
* Add ability to reset game to default settings
* maybe allow a creation mode so ppl can edit the map in multiplayer
    -> like forge
    -> simply pass along the console command to place a tile over the network and run it on the other side
    -> could be fun
* move tile down 1 layer seems lame.
    -> replace with put_tile_at_layer
        -> will just remove/reinstert tile at index in array
            -> where N is new index, if N > size, then do size instead
            -> where N is 0 or below, just put at 0
            -> all orginal tiles m (>N) become m+1
* need to see a visual pallette for selecting tiles
* implementing search algorithms for ai
    -> use stack and dfs w/ heuristic (heuristic affects ordering of enqueueing tuples)
    -> enqueue tuples of coorx,coory a certain distance from current loc in each dir (like a grid)
        -> function should take a x,y, pair and return 4 candidate pairs (1 each dir)
* make the powerups float up and down and have a shadow
* change "thetime" to have the server "say" the time after receving proper msg
* server could have a "admin" role where you can use the mapmaker
    -> actions taken by the admin broadcast to all players
        -> e.g. deleted a powerup, added a tile
* checksum checks
    -> client sends checksum of the jar, and the map file currently played
    -> server verifies these two MD5 hashes against its own md5s
* allow players to bounce off floor in sidescroller mode
    -> make a plinketto game mode
    -> scorepoints at the bottom
        -> more scorepoint props placed in the better slots
    -> have the scores in the textures for the map
        -> e.g. 5, 3, 10
* not how the spawn points have illusion of depth on wp_steam sometimes
    -> black line on top, light line on bottom
*create didicated spawn point object
    -> so they can be easily referenced when needed
    -> no more spawn errors at all
* create customTrigger object
    -> like xCom
        -> just needs to execute code
    -> have map of these objects
    -> add prop that has a string for the key of customTrigger map
        -> on intersect/destroy run the customTrigger
* gametype
    -> ball thinks like a bot, going after nearest character
        -> if you touch the ball you die
        -> get points for staying alive
*  cut down on data usage online, see if instead of using full keys, if you can use their index in the arg map
to reference them.
* replace stockhp
    -> replace all cVars usage of stockhp with calls for player0's stockhp
    -> then refactor functions to take any player not just 0
* need more vars on player and not in cvars
    -> like health
    -> handle respawns by player obj, not by user
* as a bot on sideview map, look for edges of platforms above yourself for the opportunity to jump
* make players eyes blink
* allow all textures in folder to be used in mapmaker
* new gametypes
    -> sidescrolling map scrolls past with obstacles to jump and duck
        -> like twisted system in fuzion frenzy
    -> current pulling players in one dir, where death awaits at the edge and objects try to knock you in
        -> like the jetboat waterfall in fuzion frenzy
    -> pool game mode where you try to knock ball into one of six pockets
        -> maybe only one ball/goal active at any one time
            -> scoring will change the active goal
        -> have only 4 spawn points on the map.  each spawn points gives player access to a full table
            -> players will be separated by hard walls
    -> have N-1 props each cycle where N is # players left.  players grab props but drop them when killed
        -> when timer ends anyone not holding prop dies
    -> have multiple flags each cycle.  players grab flags but drop them when killed
        -> when timer ends anyone not holding flag dies. survivors get points
    -> have N-1 safepoint each cycle where N is number of players left.  No respawning, only 30 - 60 sec allowed
* new weapons
    -> add a bomb type that functions like the bomberman64 bomb
    -> something like the rock from dod mg server
        -> bounces around and flies far and erratically
    -> jihad
* new props
    -> for race mode, bombs that explode on contact and stop you for a little
    -> pinball bumper that actual increases your bounce velocity
* idle sfx
    -> have music for background of match.
    -> loop a roylaty-free mp3
    -> reference the mp3 in mapfile or whatever
    -> have characters make chirpy muttery noises
        -> kinda like grunt from halo
    -> have them respond to events in the game
        -> deaths, objectives, etc
    -> have them grunt for punching
        -> like bomberman64
* new map lines:
    -> lockcam x y
    -> locks cam at a certain coordinate for duration of the map.
        -> no center cam, no free cam
        -> check in the commandCenterCam and commandSelectUDLR files
    -> lockscale s
        -> locks game scale at certain level for the duration of the map
        -> no zooming allowed
* add texture tiling
    -> sprite must be converted to bufferedimage before drawing
    -> on a per texture basis i.e. 3 "fill or tile" flags per tile
    -> add 7 base x/y vals for possibly tiled textures
* Create a server browser program
    -> when you start a game server it sends data to this server
    -> when you go to server browser menu in game you see data returned from here
* change vector of speed boost (RMB) depending on movement keys held down
* put visual feedback for racing positions
* add voip
* Load all images used on a map into a temp. sprite sheet to improve performance?
* ENABLE A "GRAVITY" SETTING TO PULL PLAYERS IN CERTAIN VECTOR
    -> MUST BE ABLE TO SET IT FROM MAP FILES
* TRIM THE FAT ON THE "NEW TILE/PROP/FLARE" OPTIONPANES
    -> LOOK AT THE FILE HISTORY OF RELEVANT FILES IN GITHUB
* server should have clients run a set of instructions on join
* transmit file over the server/cli connection
