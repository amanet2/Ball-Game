* CONSOLE AS INTERFACE:
    -> finish replacing the console with new interface-based model
    -> consoleShell is the old console with all commands
    -> consoleServer and consoleClient are tailored for those roles
        -> consoleSimulation too??
    -> consoleShell should delegate to consoleServer and consoleClient when needed
* xCon class is still valuable as an intake for user input
    -> SEE EXAMPLE: activatemenu() called in xCon
