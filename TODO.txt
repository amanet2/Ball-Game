* NET, UI: have client disconnect itself when data not received for X seconds
    -> echo some message on failure
* BUG: whats with the freezes?
    -> THEORY: thread-safe data structures overused and holding things up
* UI: show tiny img of weapon that killed player
    -> the echo cmd for "X got Y" is in a script
    -> make a new token '&' that specifies a killfeed icon
        -> e.g. 'echo host#blue &pistol guest#pink'
* AI: bots need to go around obstacles
    -> detect if they have not moved enough X,Y and begin the 'go-around' behavior
* GFX: make the flagdeposits and scorepoints do a color effect
    -> use color flare and color the shadow
* ITEM: create onShot script capability for items and players when they get hit by bullet object
    -> shoot landmines to disable them
    -> NEW ITEM: box that you break open for prizes
* ITEM: boost pad that gives high player velocity in a certain direction
* BUG: flags disappearing and extra flags appearing during flagmaster
* CRITICAL: client.txt gets cleared out randomly?
* QOL: make created prefabs available right away without having to restart game
* VIDEO: uiMenus framerate selection needs to update with client vars
    -> update the menu texts on the var change
* CHECK FOR MEMORY LEAKS
* COMMANDS and VARS:
    -> server var to not allow movement for IDs or all
    -> server var to not allow attacks for IDs or all
    -> 'cl_setcam' console command to set cam position
    -> client var for player id to track with the camera
    -> client var for interp
    -> server var for map name
        -> client var to sync to this as well
* BUG: Escape comma ',' characters that appear in net values
* GENERAL: if a client is also running the server, cl_setthing can be called by the server thread if server not ignored (bad)
* BUG: teleporters delay affects different colors i.e. blue teles are affected by red tele delay and vice versa
* BUG: when someones pc sleeps/closes, the client loses connection then rejoins on wake as "null"
* NET: Have server not send any other clients' vars if the client is still loading
* AUDIO: PLAYING CLIPS NEED TO CHANGE VOLUME IMMEDIATELY ON CHANGE
