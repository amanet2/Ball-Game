* CRITICAL: whats with the camera shaking when it centers on player @ 240hz and lower
* VFX: using gradient inside the texture makes performance much better on macbook
    -> but the texture tiling doesnt line up exactly at some points
* BUG: flag disappeared during flagmaster game
* CRITICAL: client.bs gets cleared out randomly?
* hud player healthbars and names need to scale when not enough screen space to show all players
* make created prefabs available right away without having to restart game
    -> can add the new prefab's script into the prefab map at some point
* include items in prefab export
* come up with better way to create and place map geometry where we dont have to define rotations manually
    -> use java polygons
        -> but might as well start a new 3d engine
* Make Camera scriptable with 'setcam' console command
* ITEM: boost pad that gives high player velocity in a certain direction
* EXCEPTION: weird exception when pressing ESC in mapmaker without any player spawns
* create onShot script capability for items and players when they get hit by bullet object
* replace all usages of "Math.Random()" with threadlocal random
* IDEA: separate weapon spawns maybe
* IDEA: glowing light that follows around the player character
* BUG VIDEO:
    -> uiMenus framerate selection needs to update with the client vars file
* MEMORY LEAK
    -> with sound?
        -> even with sound muted I see memory going up in task manager
        -> noticed shitload of threads being created when i enabled sounds
        -> try closing the audio line
    -> with animations?
        -> with muted audio and no animations, mem hovers around 300mb give or take
* Client, Server interp
    -> everytime client receives from server it sets "coords"
    -> create some config value that will set this to only occur every X milliseconds
* COMMANDS:
    -> server var to not allow movement for ID or all
    -> add race gamemode
* NETWORK: add retry limit to gamelogicclient so we disconnect and cl_echo when remote server becomes unreachable
* CONSOLE: refresh scripts from disk when loading map
    -> verify scripts aren't running when map is loading
* GIT: want to go back in time
    -> git checkout <old working commit>
    -> git checkout -b <new branch>
    -> push this branch then retarget the older branch into this new stable branch, stable branch targets main now
* TWO COMMITS TANGLED UP
    -> on target: git config pull.rebase true && git pull && git config pull.rebase false
* Engine: xCon console should be split up into server and client
* BUG: Escape comma ',' characters that appear in net values
    -> it screws up building hashmap from received data
* IDEA: multi-line for loops in scripting language
    -> QUESTION: am i making a game here or a scripting language???
* GENERAL: if a client is also running the server, cl_setthing can be called by the server thread if server not ignored (bad)
* GENERAL: increase map streaming speed
    -> OPTION: batching lines
    -> OPTION: change the client rate when downloading map
* BUG: teleporters delay affects different colors i.e. blue teles are affected by red tele delay and vice versa
* create a client var for player id to track with the camera
* fix the bug where players pop out on top of walls they shouldnt be visible behind
* create ban system using timeevents and saving timestamps to a file on close and loading
    -> on server start, check for unban vars in config file, load ids into ban map
    -> loop: check if any ban times have expire and remove player from ban map
    -> console command: banid will schedule the event to unban (remove from list of banned ids) and create svar
    -> on server close, save to file: setvar unban_<id> <time_millis>
* dont draw blocks that cant be seen on screen
* when someones pc sleeps/closes, the client loses connection then rejoins on wake as "null"
* git reset --hard <last_working_commit_id>
    -> git push --force
    -> git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name> --force
    -> see for remotes: git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>
* NET: Have server not send any other clients' vars if the client is still loading
* NET: The maximum safe UDP payload is ??? bytes
* add cod zombies-style gametype, bots will be unarmed but real players will always have weapons
    -> or moving items can act as zombies
* powerups
    -> an egg you pick it up and it expands until explosion
* GAME: bring back squish effect for movement/momentum changes and bounces
* new Item: destructible box/crate
    -> get itemvar "health" to 0 and it should exec spawnpointgiverbonus script
* other attacks:
    -> rock lazily flies, either bounces or stops when collides with walls/players (rock from maniac gungame)
    -> right click could drop a timed bomb, left click kicks it forward
    -> hold mouse to blow a bubble and release it before it pops
* COMMIT SPOT CHECKS
    -> GO TO COMMIT: git checkout <commit>
    -> GO BACK: git checkout <branch_name>
* PLAYING CLIPS NEED TO CHANGE VOLUME IMMEDIATELY ON CHANGE
* add "disable attacks" option
* make players eyes blink
* Create a server browser program w/ flask or something
* add voip
