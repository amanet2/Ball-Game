* BUG: teleporter doesnt work sometimes
* CPU: cpu usage nearly 30% on 13700k
    -> can some threads like client sleep instead of busy-wait?
* FREEZING: major hitches randomly during gameplay
    -> THEORY: thread-safe data structures holding things up?
* AI: bots need to go around obstacles
    -> detect if they have not moved enough X,Y in a certain time frame and begin the 'go-around' behavior
* NET: when someone's pc sleeps/closes, that client loses connection then rejoins on wake as "null"
    -> test with the macbook air and closing the lid
