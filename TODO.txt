* FREEZING: major hitches randomly during gameplay
    -> THEORY: thread-safe data structures holding things up?
    -> OBSERVATION: during a freeze it seems the camera moved up and had to travel back to player pos
    -> QUESTION: does player count influence this? does it matter if the players are human or bots?
