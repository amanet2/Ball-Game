* spawn protection visibility not working correctly
    -> broken in very first commit to player_ids
        -> client always sees a forbidden sign over himself
            -> line in setupGame() where we give the player an id
                -> all til now the player0 never got an id, and the camera tracked by index, not id so an id was never needed
        -> server never shows forbidden sign
            -> actually this never worked even in master branch
